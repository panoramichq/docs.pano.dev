# Company Settings

Company Settings contain the main setup information for admins and analysts to manage the data that is available to their company, as well as which users and teams have access to the data.

## Sharing

\[Enterprise Tier Only\] 

Sharing allows you to invite users from other companies into your company. This is very useful when you work with an external consulting company who you would like to share access with for a limited period of time, or if you have an organizational relationship with another company and have agreed to share reporting, or an agency who could better report and optimize if they are given access to live, dynamic reporting metrics.

You can always view the companies that you have shared access within your company settings, and revoke access at any time. 

Keep in mind, administrators of shared companies will have access to your Workspaces and Company Settings to help manage your organization. Edit and View users from the shared company will only have access to Workspaces and must be explicitly invited into each Workspace.

## Teams

Teams are a great way to organize users within your organization. Grouping users by their team will make it easier to keep track of which Workspaces they should have access to and helps route comments in Collaboration to the relevant team. 

## Users

Users are invited at the Company Level. Users reflect people within your organization that will be added to Workspaces as Collaborators. 

Adding users allows you to work with other members of your team to connect, model, define and transform data in your organization. 

Depending on your license, you may have a limit on the number of users that can be invited to your company. Reach out to your account rep if you would like to add additional users.

## Data Connections

Data Connections store the credentials to all of your physical data sources, these can be databases, cloud data warehouses, file storage systems, etc. You can add as many Data Connections as you need into the Platform. All the underlying data in these connections will then become available for mapping and modeling into Datasets.

## Datasets

Datasets allow you to define virtual "groupings" of similar data, independent of where that data is stored. If you have CRM data in 3 schemas across 2 data connections, combine it all into a single dataset so that you can define the joins between related dimensions and analyze it as if it was all stored in one nice and clean schema.

## Glossary

The Company Glossary stores the universe of all fields that are mapped in datasets or calculated fields created in any Workspaces. This view lets admins and analysts keep a centralized record of all fields and their corresponding definitions, calculations and other metadata to make sure all users have access to the data they need and are able to perform their analyses safely.
