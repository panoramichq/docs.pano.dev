# Company Settings

Company Settings are the main section for admins and analysts to manage the data that is available to the organization, as well as which users and teams have access to which data

## Company Settings

### Sharing

Sharing allows you to invite users from other companies into your company. This is very useful when you work with an external consulting company who you would like to share data with for a limited period of time, or if you have an organizational relationship with another company and have agreed to share reporting, or an agency who could better report and optimize if they are given access to live, dynamic reporting metrics.

You can always view the companies that you have shared access with in your company settings, and revoke access at any time. 

Keep in mind, administrators of shared companies will have access to your Workspaces and Company Settings to help manage your organization. Edit and View users from the shared company will only have access to Workspaces and must be explicitly invited into each Workspace.

### Teams

Teams are a great way to organize users within your organization. Grouping users by their team will make it easier to keep track of which Workspaces they should have access to and helps route comments in Collaboration to the relevant team. 

### Users

Users are invited at the Company Level. Users reflect people within your organization that will be added to Workspaces as Collaborators.

Adding users allows you to work with other members of your team to connect, model, define and transform data in your organization. 

Under the free tier you are limited to individual analysts. To  loop in additional members of your team for reporting and analysis, consider upgrading to the Growth tier
