### **Onboarding Step 3: Add Teams**

Now that you’ve created a Workspace or two, and added Collections to these Workspaces, it’s time to create Teams. Teams are groups of Users that you can set up to enable quick communication.

To Create a Team:

1. Log in to your Panoramic account
2. Under your Company Settings Menu, navigate to the **TEAMS** tab
3. Select **CREATE TEAM** on the top right corner
4. Enter the Team name you wish to use. Common examples include Data Science, Marketing, Operations, Paid Media, etc.
5. Select **CREATE**

_Note: If you don’t yet know which teams you want to create, you can always create a default “General” team name and go back to this place and edit them anytime in your Company Settings._
