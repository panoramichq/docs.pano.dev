# Users

## **Adding Users**

It’s time to add Users and grant others access to Pano so you can all begin to visualize and analyze your data together.

Users are any colleague or representative who you would like to give access to your data. Within Pano, there are three types of User Roles: Admin, Edit, and View Users. See below for a breakdown of functionality per role.

To Add a User at the Company Level:

1. Log in to your Pano account
2. Under your Company Settings Menu, navigate to the **USERS** tab
3. Select **ADD USERS** on the top right corner
4. Enter the User’s company Email Address, Team, and Role
5. Select **ADD**

_Note: Users are added at the Company level only, while Collaborators are added only at the Workspace level in the case that you grant other Companies access to your data, and want to set permissions around their access \(i.e. different agencies per Workspace, or different levels of access per Workspace\)._
