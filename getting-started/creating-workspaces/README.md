# Workspaces

## **What is a Workspace?**

Workspaces are secure areas for teams to collaborate around their data. Within one Company, there can be multiple Workspaces. It is hard to analyze in a silo, give teams a unified view of the business so they can make better contextual decisions.

Workspaces allow you to group together relevant boards, dataframes and conversations, while allowing you to customize permissions \(e.g. giving access to one agency for certain campaigns, or sectioning off access per teams for different product lines\).

Workspaces are commonly used to separate your data by:

* Marketing channel
* Product lines
* Store locations or regions
* Initiatives
* Movie titles

For example, if you are a film studio, you would likely create a new project for each film you work on. If you run an e-commerce website, you might create different projects for each product, major campaign, or break give your agency different access from your brand team. We recommend you work closely with the Customer Success team to help organize based on your company structure and goals.
