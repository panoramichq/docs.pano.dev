# Connecting Datasets

### **Connecting Datasets**

For a full rundown on Datasets and how to define them, [click here](../../data-preparation/creating-datasets/). If a Workspace does not have any datasets connected, then no data will appear. Once you've defined your datasets and created a Workspace, next you’ll need to connect your datasets.

To Connect a Dataset to a Workspace:

1. Navigate to your desired Workspace
2. Select **Datasets** from the Main Workspace Menu
3. Select **Dataset**
4. Navigate to the Dataset in the dialog
5. Select **CONNECT** on the Dataset\(s\) you want to connect to this Workspace
6. Select **CONNECT ACCOUNT**

Once you’ve connected your datasets, your data will be available for querying and transformation within the Workspace.
