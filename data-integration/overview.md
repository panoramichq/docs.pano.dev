# Overview

## What is data integration?

Let's face it, learning another dashboarding tool is a pain if you just spent a year setting up Tableau and getting everyone to use it. With Panoâ€™s workflow integrations, you can easily clean and model your underlying data and then push simple, unified analyses back out to a growing list of sources and integrated partners

Panoramic offers a unique ability to sync live, dynamic views of your transformed, report ready data out to integrated partners and services. The goal is to share valuable, insightful and clear information out to the tools that you use, in a format that makes the most sense in the context of that service. 

The Panoramic system always centralizes around the same flow 1\) connect data 2\) map data 3\) transform data 4\) save transformations to boards. A board, and the transformations & insights contained within each board serve as the data contract to define what final information should be shared with teammates or integrated tools. 

We often consider the the structure of the panoramic system in database terms, its easiest to consider Workspaces as a virtual database, Boards as a virtual schema and transformations as virtual tables. If you keep this mental model, you can start to think about assembling your data in the Panoramic system similar to how you would set up a new database for your company, but now you have complete freedom to structure it based on the needs of your teammates instead of worrying about the optimal performance of the database. 

These charts and boards will become the window into your underlying data, and they can be shared directly with our list of integrated partners, so the data you transform and publish will be available for reporting and visualization in these other tools. 

Centralize your logic, govern access to the data and share live views into your company metrics.
