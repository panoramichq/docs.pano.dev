# Overview

## What is data integration?

Let's face it, learning another dashboarding tool is a pain if you just spent a year setting up Tableau and getting everyone to use it. With Panoâ€™s workflow integrations, you can easily clean and model your underlying data and then push simple, unified dataframes back out to a growing list of sources and integrated partners.

Pano offers a unique ability to sync live, dynamic views of your transformed, report ready data out to integrated partners and services. Our goal is to share valuable, insightful and clear information out to the tools that you use, in the format that fits best within the context of that service.

Pano always centers around the same basic flow 1\) connect data 2\) map data 3\) transform data 4\) save transformations to boards. A board, and the transformations & insights contained within each board serve as the data contract to define what final information should be shared with teammates or integrated tools. 

We often consider the the structure of Pano transforms in database terms, its easiest to consider Workspaces as a virtual database, Boards as a virtual schema and dataframes as virtual tables. If you keep this mental model, you can start to think about assembling your data in Pano similar to how you would set up a new database for your company, but now you have complete freedom to structure it based on the needs of your teammates instead of worrying about the optimal performance of the database. 

These boards and transformed dataframes will become the window into your underlying data, and they can be shared directly with our list of integrated partners, so the data you publish will be available for reporting and visualization within other tools.
