# Data Security

### **GDPR / CCPA Compliance**

We’ve built Pano with the user’s privacy top of mind. To mitigate any privacy concerns, every single person who has access to your data has a unique User account - including Pano internal employees to help you troubleshoot. That way you know who is handling your inquiries and viewing your information. If you’re ever in doubt, head over to the Collaborators tab under your Workspace to view who has Access. Panoramic Engineering and Customer Success who have access will always be listed.
