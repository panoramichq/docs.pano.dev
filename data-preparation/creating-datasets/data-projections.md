# Data Projections

sometimes there is data that is structured in a format that isnt ideal for panoramic's query service, in these cases its necessary to transform the datasets into a data structure that can be queried. There are a few common examples that are covered with some out-of-the-box projection templates. These include:

* deduplication of rows in a table
* Un-pivoting or un-flattening datasets that have already been transposed

This is also a great solution to apply any custom transformations that you need in order to manipulate your data to a form where it is "report-ready"

You have the ability to write pure SQL transformations that will be executed by panoramic to ensure data is properly transformed

multiple transformations can be chained together in a sequential order so you can perform complex transformations on your data
