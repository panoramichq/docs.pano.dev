#### **Below are a few tips to prepare your CSV File for Import:**

1. The first row in your file should always contain fixed column headings
2. Always include a Date column in every upload
3. Each row following your column headings should include data relevant to the respective column heading
4. For every new upload, you may omit row values, but ensure column headings never change
5. Include only raw metrics \(**not calculated**\) in your file. The platform will calculate metrics based on your guidelines. Removing calculated metrics helps with viewability and accuracy of your data.
   1. **Good Example:** date, spend, impressions
   2. **Bad Example**: date, spend, impressions, cpm
6. If using a spreadsheet application like Excel or Google Sheets, please double check the values prior to uploading as some applications reformat data like dates, currency, or percentiles
7. If using a text editor instead of a spreadsheet application keep in mind:

#### **FORMATTING - BEST PRACTICES:**

Below are a few additional formatting tips when structuring your CSV:

* **Date Format:** yyyy/mm/dd
* **Currency:** do not include currency symbol
* **Integer data:** must be whole numbers
* **Percent:** if no decimal, include the %  \(e.g. 80% v 81.7\)
* **Delete** any subtotal or total rows
* **Remove** any special characters from numeric columns  \(null, N/A, --, na, etc\)
* **Remove** any white spaces within cells
* **Remove** any empty rows and columns throughout the file
* **Encoding** of the file must be UTF-8
