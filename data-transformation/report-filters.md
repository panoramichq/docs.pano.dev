# Data Filters

## **The Hierarchy of Filters**

## **Workspace-Level Filters**

To filter the data you see at the Workspace level, try applying Workspace Filters. Here's how:

Go to your Data Sources tab within a Workspace. 

Select the More Icon

to the right of the Data Source you want to filter. For example, let's say you know your West Coast store openings are only being advertised on Facebook, you would only need to apply the filter to your Facebook Ads account.

Use the filter options. For example, if you want to Filter by Campaign Name, select **CAMPAIGN NAME** in the first dropdown, then select the condition **EQUALS ANY OF,** then select the value which is the actual Campaign Name you want to filter.

Select **SAVE** once you have applied one or more Filters to that Data Source
