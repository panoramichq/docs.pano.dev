# Data Explorer

## **What Is Data Explorer?**

Data Explorer allows any users to dive deeper into any Dataframe and explore additional Fields, breakdowns and visualizations and it allows Admin or Edit users to create their own customized charts and boards, utilizing the connected Datasets in any Workspace.

**Data Blending** allows you to build charts that incorporate multiple platforms \(ie. Facebook/IG and Google Search\), and "blend" together metrics that do not natively map together. Data Blending is supported by Custom Fields, Data Explorer, and the Glossary.

At the top of Data Explorer you will see the table or visualization that you've built as it will appear when its published to the board. Below it you'll see all the data that feeds into that Dataframe starting with the tab for "Blended data" and followed by tabs for each individual dataset that feeds in.
