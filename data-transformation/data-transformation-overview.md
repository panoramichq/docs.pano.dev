# Overview

## What is Data Transformation?

Data transformation is the process of converting data from one table or structure into another table or structure. Normally there is some business logic applied during each transformation that gets the data one step closer to its final result... a valuable business report. 

#### Why transform data?

You might want to transform your data for a number of reasons. Generally, businesses want to transform data to make it compatible with other data, move it to another system, join it with other data, add information to enrich your data or aggregate metrics in the data. Having trouble keeping track of all your sales data, marketing data, customer data, web analytics & ecommerce data?
