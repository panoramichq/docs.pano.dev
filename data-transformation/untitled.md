# Dynamic SQL Querying \(Husky\)

## Why is dynamic querying important?

Cost / speed / performance

Updates and changes to underlying data, you shouldn't be managing the SQL scripts to aggregate your data, then you have a chain of dependencies to maintain and update all the time. The important thing is keeping your data mapped, and mapping new data, once its mapped correctly it becomes easy to reformat queries to fetch the right data from the right location

> **Code generation** is the process of generating executable code \(e.g. SQL, Python, R, or other executable instructions\) that will transform the data based on the desired and defined data mapping rules.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation#cite_note-4) Typically, the data transformation technologies generate this code[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation#cite_note-5) based on the definitions or metadata defined by the developers.
