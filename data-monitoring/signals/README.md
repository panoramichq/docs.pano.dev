# Signals

## What is a Signal?

Signals are a section in Panoramic where users are able to create custom threshold settings for summary metrics. Users are able to create Signals in a Panoramic Workspace and be notified in their Feed.

**Can I create a Signal for a date that is in the past?**

You can create a Signal for a date that begins in the past, but it must have an end date that is in the future.

Your date range must also be at least 24 hours.

**Can I create a Signal for multiple data sources?**

Just like in Data Tagging, you can create multiple Signals across data sources, but each individual signal is Data source specific.

**What is level of granularity that I can track?**

You can input the time in the highest granularity available to the data source selected. For example: Because hourly is available for Facebook Ads, Signals using Facebook Ads as the data source, will be able to input a specific hour of the day for the start/end date.

**What happens if I make changes to my Workspace mid-flight?**

If Workspace Filters are edited while Signals are scheduled in the future **OR** some Signals are mid-flight, when a Workspace, the new updates will not apply to the current Signals.

**What if I want to track a rate metric?**

We are working on adding rate metrics as the next iteration of Signals and will be releasing this soon!

Just as in Chart Builder and Data Tagging, select your Data Source, apply relevant filters to make sure you're pacing the right data set

Select the date range, the summary metric you want to track, the Target value, and the threshold.

For example: A user might want to pace your overall spend for a data source, and receive a notification when you are "Above", "Below" or "Above or Below" a percentage of the threshold that has been set.
