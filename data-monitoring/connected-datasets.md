# Connected Datasets

### **Connect Datasets**

Datasets are the pipes that feed data into the Panoramic platform that are ultimately fed to measure and view marketing performance. A Data Source is considered to be everything from a Facebook report directly from their API to a custom CSV uploaded with proprietary data specific to your needs. If a Workspace did not have any Data Sources connected, then no data will appear.

Now that you’ve connected your data, defined your datasets and created a Workspace, next you’ll need to connect your datasets.

To Connect a Data Source within Panoramic:

1. Navigate to your desired Workspace
2. Select **DATA SOURCES** from the Main Workspace Menu
3. Select **ADD DATA SOURCE**
4. Navigate to the Collection where your Data Source would fall under \(e.g. Facebook = Paid Social, AppNexus = Programmatic, etc.\)
5. Select **CONNECT** on the Data Source\(s\) you want to connect to this Workspace
6. Enter the ID of that Data Source. This is typically the Account, Customer or Advertiser ID that appears under Account Settings within the Data Source itself. If you cannot find this ID, please contact Customer Success to help you locate it.
7. Select **CONNECT ACCOUNT**

Once you’ve connected your Data Sources, your data will be available for querying and transformation within the Workspace.

**Access to a Workspace**

Workspaces can only be created by an Admin level user. In order for an Edit or View user to have access to a Workspace, only an Admin or an Edit user with existing access to that Workspace can invite a new user.
