# Overview

## Data Monitoring & Insights

Data is only useful if you understand it and know how to take action. Many BI tools only offer the ability to visualize your data, but that requires you to perform manual analysis and takes a lot of time. With Pano, you connect your data, contextualize it by adding benchmarks and goals, then we monitor and let you know when something interesting happens.
