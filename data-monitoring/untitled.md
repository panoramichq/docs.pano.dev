# Boards

## **Anatomy of a Board**

Boards are dashboards, made up of charts, within each of your Workspaces. Boards display the information you need to answer relevant business questions based on the information input during the login process. 

Boards can either be "Featured Boards" or a "Custom Board" that you or a teammate have created specific for your use case. The data sources you connect to the Workspace feed into each board. 

To start to see your data visualized, go to **Featured Boards** and select a Board within your activated Collection \(example for Paid Social Advertising shown below\).

### 

Both **Featured Boards** and **Custom Boards** will have the same primary navigation consisting of:

**Workspace Navigation, Board-Level Exports, Board Bookmarks, Board-Level Filters, and Charts:**

* **Workspace Navigation -** enables you to move back to the respective Boards tab or to the Main Workspace Menu
* **Board-Level Exports** - easily export any of your visuals to PDF or Excel
* **Board Bookmarks** - bookmark a Board so you can easily come back to it every time you enter your Workspace
* **Board-Level Filters** - allowing you to apply a Date Filter and a Benchmark once that then affects all Charts within that Board
* **Charts** - visual representations of your data

To View a **Featured Board**:

1. Navigate to your desired Workspace
2. Select **FEATURED BOARDS** from the Main Workspace Menu
3. Scroll down to the name of the Collection you’ve added to this Workspace
4. Select the relevant Board you want to see within your desired Collection. In most cases, there will be both a Cross-Channel Board, incorporating Charts for more than one Data Source, as well as an Individual Board per Data Source connected \(i.e. Facebook Ads Board\)
5. Scroll through the Charts available on that Board, experiment with: Date Filters, Board Filters, Benchmarks, Exporting Functionality and Chart Filters

## **Create Custom Boards and Charts**

Custom Boards are any Boards that have been customized to fit your unique reporting needs. As mentioned in the Anatomy of Panoramic, to create a Custom Board with visuals useful for analysis, you’ll need to create both a **Custom Board** and **Custom Chart**.

To Create a Custom Board:

1. Log in to your Panoramic account
2. Navigate to your desired Workspace
3. Select **CUSTOM BOARDS** from the Main Workspace Menu
4. Select **CREATE BOARD** to the far right of the Custom Boards screen
5. To customize your Board, select the Pencil icon on the right. Here you can update the Board Name to a name of your choice, and/or select a color for your Board.
6. Select **SAVE** to confirm your customizations.

A Chart in Panoramic is an individual chart, graph, scatter plot or any data visualization - including a table. Multiple Charts make up a single Board. Boards do not require a minimum number of Charts, and you can mix and match Charts from both Featured Boards and Custom Boards.

To create a **Custom Chart**, you first need to create your own Board. Follow the steps below to Build your own board with Custom Charts.

Within your Workspace, select the **CUSTOM BOARDS** tab on the left sidebar navigation of your Workspace.

Here you will see any existing Custom Boards for your Workspace, filtered by status \(Published/Hidden/Drafts\). To create a new Board, select **CREATE BOARD** to the far right of the Custom Boards screen.

Customize the Name and Description of your board prior to adding a Chart. Simply select the Edit icon to the far right of the screen

Once you have customized your new Board name, it’s time to start creating Charts to populate your Board. To create a new Chart, select **CREATE CHART** at the bottom of your new Board home screen and then visit the "Data Explorer" page to learn the details of a chart
