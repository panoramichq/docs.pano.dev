# Overview

> A **business glossary** makes it possible to define fields used within an enterprise. It is a trusted reference business “dictionary” in an organization.

## What is the Glossary?

The Glossary's main objectives, among others, are to:

* Use the same definitions and create a common language between all employees
* Have better understanding and collaboration between business and IT teams
* Associate business terms to other assets in the enterprise and offer an overview of their different connections
* Elaborate and share a set of rules regarding data governance

Custom Fields allow you to create customized metrics to be used in your data transformations. Some reasons why you might create a Custom Term:

* You use a calculated metric in your reporting that isn't available in the underlying dataset
* You want to re-name a Standard Event with an easier to use alias \(ie. Checkouts Initiated renamed to "Showtime Lookup"
* You want to use Data Blending and create your own cross Dataset dimensions 

#### Company Glossary

Your Company Glossary will capture and store all the fields across all Workspaces. Company admins will have access to the Company Glossary.

#### Workspace Glossary

Permissions and access is managed via Workspaces, this allows company admins to share specific fields into a workspace and trust that the collaborators in that Workspace will only have access to the data they need.
