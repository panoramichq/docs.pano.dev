# Overview

## What is the Glossary?

Custom Terms allow you to create customized metrics to be used in your Custom Boards. Some reasons why you might create a Custom Term:

* You use a calculated metric in your reporting that isn't available in the Panoramic Feature Glossary
* You want to re-name a Standard Event with an easier to use alias \(ie. Checkouts Initiated renamed to "Showtime Lookup"
* You want to use Data Blending

#### Company Glossary

Navigate to your Glossary, you can either have a Company Glossary that will be available for all Workspaces, or add terms that are only specific and accessible to an individual Workspace

#### Workspace Glossary

Permissions and access is managed via workspaces, this allows company admins to share specific fields into a workspace and trust that the collaborators in that workspace will only have access to the data they should, and not leak sensitive information where you dont want it
